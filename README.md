- Each problem solution is in its **own file**.  
- Future problems will be added to the appropriate folder.

## ⚙️ Notes

- Solutions are implemented in JavaScript (or TypeScript where noted).  
- File names are **lowercase with underscores** for consistency.  
- This repo will grow as I complete more challenges.
